Simple checker for iPhone 13 Pro Max availability. Outputs JSON summary of available items (when available).

Usage:

```
# Replace 94110 with your postcode.
$ python3 check.py 94110
```
**Anecdote:** I left this running for ~1 hour in a terminal and was able to nab a freshly available iPhone 13 Max Pro.
